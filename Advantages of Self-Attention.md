Self-attention has several advantages over traditional encoder-decoder architectures:

- **Parallelism:** Unlike sequential models, transformers process all words at once, making training faster.
- **Transfer Learning:** Pretrained transformer models can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets for various tasks.
- **Long-Range Dependencies:** Self-attention can relate distant words without losing information.
